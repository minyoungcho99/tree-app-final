## Overview

**Treeviz** was born out of a common frustration: course registration is confusing. Students often struggle to visualize the prerequisites required for the classes they want to take â€” especially when prerequisites span multiple semesters or form complex AND/OR chains. Existing tools like Oscar, DegreeWorks, and GT Scheduler either lack visual clarity, are outdated, or do not support holistic long-term planning.

## Problem Statement

Most Georgia Tech students run into issues when trying to plan out their courses across semesters. Long chains of prerequisites make it hard to decide which classes to take and when. Missing even one course in a chain can delay graduation.

To address this, weâ€™ve framed our problem as:

> *New college students require a user-friendly and guided platform to effectively manage and comprehend complex prerequisite chains for their courses. However, they often face challenges with initial navigation and effective organization due to a less intuitive user interface and a lack of instructional support, making their first-time experience frustrating and inefficient.*
